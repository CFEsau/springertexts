The list of available Springer texts can be found at https://link.springer.com/search/page/2?facet-content-type=%22Book%22&package=mat-covid19_textbooks&facet-language=%22En%22&sortOrder=newestFirst&showAll=true

All of these titles have been saved in SearchResults.csv. This file can be modified to remove any unwanted titles.
Alternatively, you can select books by discipline/subdiscipline and download a new list of titles directly from the Springer website search.

springerdl.py downloads the pdf and epub files for each of the titles in SearchResults.csv.
The script requires the header of the csv file to run (i.e. the top line beginning 'Item Title').
